### By categories

It is also possible to browse the offers by categories. This can be useful if you're unsure what position you are looking for, but have a general idea about your preferred field. You can start by defining your [location](#by-location) or entirely skip this step.

At the bottom of the screen, you can choose from the following categories:

{% include Categories.svg %}

They include options such as *Aplikuj szybko* (*apply fast*) - jobs with a simplified application process - or *pierwsza praca* (*first job*) - a great option if you have little or no professional experience.

**Important tip 4:** In order to check a specific category name in English, refer to the [Glossary](#glossary).
