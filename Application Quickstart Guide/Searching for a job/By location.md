### By location

Do you already live in a great city? Or are you looking to move to a place that offers more opportunities? In both cases, you can use the *miasto lub województwo* (*city or voivodeship*) field. It allows you to search for a job in your preferred location: either by city or voivodeship (a Polish administrative region). After tapping it, you will see the list of the biggest Polish cities. You can either choose one of the given options or type your own:

{% include Cities.svg %}

After choosing your location, you can also broaden your search by defining the preferred distance from it. This is the screen after searching for a **Technical Writer** position in the city of **Warsaw**:

{% include Search2.svg %}

In the second field, on the right, you can now **define the distance** from your preferred location. After tapping the **+0 km** option, you will see the range of numbers, from 0 to 50 km. This means that if you define the distance as 10 km, the app will show you the job offers from companies that are located within 10 km from Warsaw. This feature is best to use when you are flexible with your location, but not if you want your job to be in the city center.

**Important tip 2:** Sometimes, the job location does not matter. Do not use the location field if you are looking for a remote opportunity or are open to relocate to any part of the country.

**Important tip 3:** Under the location field, you can find the *dodaj więcej filtrów* (*add more filters*) option. It allows you to further specify your job search by defining: your professional field, type of contract, work schedule, position level, salary, time when the offer was published, and work mode. You can learn more about these features in our complete [User Guide](#user-guide) (in preparation).

After defining your critieria, tap *Szukaj* (*search*).
