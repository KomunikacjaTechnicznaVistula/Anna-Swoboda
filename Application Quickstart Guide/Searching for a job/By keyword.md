### By keyword

If you are looking for a new job, you certainly have a position that you are qualified for or simply interested in. Or maybe there is this one company that has caught your attention? This is where the *stanowisko lub firma* (*position or company*) field comes in. Here, you can enter a job title (for example: Product Owner, Technical Writer, FrontEnd Developer), a company name (Capgemini, Microsoft, Atlassian, etc.) or even a particular job skill (French, Spanish, Java, Jira). You can also combine the keywords and type more than one. However, try not to be too specific: typing too many keywords limits the number of available job offers.

**Important tip 1:** employers who use the **Pracuj.pl app** very often publish in English. So, you don't need to speak Polish to use the search feature!
