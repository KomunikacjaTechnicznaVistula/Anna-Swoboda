# Application Quickstart Guide

First, let's learn how to **download, install** and **discover the basic features** of the **Pracuj.pl app**. Without creating an account, you will be able to browse jobs by:

* key words,
* location,
* category.

**Creating an account** gives you a lot more possibilities. This useful feature allows you to:
* save job offers, 
* apply for jobs,
* create your own documents, such as CVs and cover letters.
  
If you wish to **create an account** and explore the advanced functions of the **Pracuj.pl app**, refer to our complete [User Guide](#user-guide) (in preparation).

For terminological issues (after all, the app is available only in Polish...), feel free to use our [glossary](#glossary).
